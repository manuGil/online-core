Reference Surfaces
------------------  

We use reference surfaces (i.e. datum systems) to approximate the shape of the Earth. A horizontal datum (also called geodetic datum) is a model used to measure positions on the Earth. A vertical datum is a model used to measure elevations. The elevations are usually related to a mean sea level.

   **Question.**
   In the Netherlands, elevation is measured using as reference the water level in the canals of Amsterdam. This  vertical datum is called Normal Amsterdams Peil (NAP). A large part of the Netherlands would flood if we would not have any dunes or dikes. In fact, all land below 0 meters NAP would be sea. Different countries measure height by referencing to different mean sea levels. Why do we not use one measure for all countries?
