How To Use the Exercises
========================

This website contains a list of exercises that you will carry out as part of the online course *"GI Science and Earth Observation: a system-based approach"*.

Along with the exercises, you will be asked to perform several activities:

+ **Read the Living Textbook** to obtain theoretical knowledge of the concepts used in the exercises. Be aware that the exercises do not provide a full explanation of the topics in the course. Therefore, you also have to study reference materials mentioned here. *Whenever relevant information is available in the Living Textbook*, you will see a |ltb| `hyperlink like this <#>`_ in the text. 

+ **Perform pencil and paper tasks** to reinforce your understanding. Although this is an online course, you will be asked to do some task that required to write things down or perform some computations. You can use calculators or spreadsheets to do the calculations, but remember that what it is essential is that you learn the procedure required for each computation.

+ **Perform software tasks using QGIS** to acquire skills and enhance your understanding of specific topics. For most of the tasks, we will provide tutorials (description or video) on how to things. Such tutorials will be more detailed in the first exercises and less detailed in later exercises. We expect that by the end of the course you become an independent **Quantum GIS** user, in the topics covered in this course. 

+ **Answer questions and participate in the Virtual Classroom**. Each exercise contains questions that you should answer while conducting the exercises. Such questions will help you to assess your understanding of a certain concept or topic.  Therefore, take the time to analyse them and provide the best answer you can. During the Virtual Classroom session, we will discuss the answers. 



Structure
---------

This document is divided into five parts:

+ **Part one** contains general information about the exercises. That is the part you are reading right now. 
+ **Part two** contains exercises related to *GI Science*, where you can learn about Geographic Information Systems and Spatial Analysis. 
+ **Part three** contains exercises related to *Earth Observation*, where you can learn about Remote Sensing and Image Interpretation. 
+ **Part four** contains exercises related to *Data Integration*, where you can learn about system dynamics and approaches to integrate data from multiple sources and perform advanced analysis. 
+ **Part five**, the *Appendices* contain additional information that will be useful for some of the exercises.




Conventions
-----------

Along with this document, we use some formating conventions to highlight content that requires special attention. These are as follows:

.. note:: 
   **QGIS.**
   This will provide additional explanations specific to how Quantum GIS works. 

.. note:: 
   **Reflection.**
   This will describe situations or post questions that require a deep level of reasoning. You should see this content as *mental puzzles* that will help to broaden your understanding of certain topics.   

.. important:: 
   **Resources.**
   This will describe the software and datasets required for completing a certain exercise. Not all exercises require you to use data; therefore, this will appear only on the sections that do need it. 


.. attention:: 
   **Question.**
   This will post questions that you have to answer during the exercises. Write down your answer and take them to the virtual classroom.


Reporting Issues
----------------

If you would like to report any issues in this document. You can do so by opening an issue in this `GitHub repository <https://github.com/manuGil/online-core/issues`_. 

Include the following:
    1. A short, but precise description of the issue,
    2. A link to the title of the specific section that contains the issues. *You can find the URL of a title's section by click on the*  **chain icon**  *on the right side of title's section.*
    3. Optionally, include a screenshot of the part of the section containing the issue.

Relevant issues to report:
    + Broken links. 
    + Wrong referencing, e.g., links do not refer to the correct resources. 
    + Missing or incomplete content. Text or figures.
    + Grammatical errors. We use British spelling.

.. danger::  You will notice that **Tasks** are not numbered correctly. We are aware of this and we are working to fix it. Do not report this as an issue.
