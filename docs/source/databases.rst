Databases: Data Entry
=====================


Direct (or primary) spatial data acquisition 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. admonition:: Resources

   This exercise requires no data and no specific software. 


Spatial data can be obtained from several sources  There has been an increase of data acquired (or produced) using remote sensed sources, such as satellite imagery. 

Other sources of spatial data include aerial photographs, traditional surveying and crowdsourcing. Different spatial data sources imply that what can be expected depends on the strengths and weaknesses of each particular source and associated acquisition methods. 

.. attention:: 
   **Discussion.**
   Fill in the table below entering at least one possible advantage and one possible disadvantage for each data source.

    .. [#] It should be noted that aerial surveys are a form of remote sensing, but not from space.
