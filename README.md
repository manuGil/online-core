If approve by the relevant authorities, several changes and improvement need to be made to the lastest version of the exercises in order to attract the attention of potential users/students. Here as some of them.

1. Make exercises and its content idependent of the content and activities hosted in Canvas.
2. Integrate or make content independent of the 'video-lectures' when relevant. If opting for an integration the videos need to be editted to only include the parts that are relevant to the exercises and remove parts that are not useful for the online audiences (e.g., openings and ansering questions from he audience).
3. Add an introduction chapter to frame the scope of the materials and for whom the material is relevant. Also, relate seamlessly the course objective (withouth the ITC jargon) to the context and cotent of the material.
4. Remove unnecessary retoric from the text.
5. Decide on dependecy with the Living Textbook.
6. Host datasets outside Canvas.
